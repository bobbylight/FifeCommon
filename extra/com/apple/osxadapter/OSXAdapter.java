	Description:A single class with clear, static entry points for hooking existing preferences,
				about, quit functionality from an existing Java app into handlers for the Mac OS X
				application menu.  Useful for developers looking to support 
				multiple platforms with a single codebase, and support Mac OS X features with 
				minimal impact.

				This sample is designed for Java 1.4.1 and later on Mac OS X.
