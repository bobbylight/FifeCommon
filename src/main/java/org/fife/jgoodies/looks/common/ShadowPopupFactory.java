/**
 * The JGoodies Looks implementation of <code>PopupFactory</code>.
 * Adds a drop shadow border to all popups except ComboBox popups.
 * It is installed by the JGoodies Plastic L&amp;F, as well as by
 * the JGoodies Windows L&amp;F during the Look&amp;Feel initialization,
 * see <code>com.jgoodies.looks.plastic.PlasticLookAndFeel#initialize</code>
 * <code>com.jgoodies.looks.windows.WindowsLookAndFeel#initialize</code>.<p>
 *
 * This factory shall not be used on platforms that provide native drop shadows,
 * such as the Mac OS X. Therefore the invocation of the {@link #install()}
 * method will have no effect on such platforms.<p>
 *
 * <strong>Note:</strong> To be used in a sandbox environment, this PopupFactory
 * requires two AWT permissions: <code>createRobot</code> and
 * <code>readDisplayPixels</code>. The reason for it is, that in the case of
 * the heavy weight popups this PopupFactory uses a Robot to snapshot
 * the screen background to simulate the drop shadow effect.
